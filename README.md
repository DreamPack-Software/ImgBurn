ImgBurn is a popular, lightweight, free optical disc authoring software for Windows that creates, writes, and verifies image files (like ISO, BIN, CUE) and data onto CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs, offering powerful features for both beginners and advanced users, though users should be cautious during installation to avoid bundled adware.
